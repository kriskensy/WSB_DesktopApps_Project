# Diving 4 Life  

## Overview  
Diving 4 Life is a WPF-based desktop application designed to help divers analyze their dive logs by generating detailed reports on various aspects of their dives. The application provides insights into key metrics such as dive duration, gas consumption, and ascent rate to improve safety and efficiency in diving.  

## Features  
- **Dive Duration Report** – Analyzes dive times over a selected period.  
- **SAC (Surface Air Consumption) Report** – Calculates air consumption efficiency based on logged dive data.  
- **Safety Report** – Evaluates ascent rates to identify potentially risky rapid ascents.  
- Interactive data visualization using LiveCharts.  
- MVVM architecture for maintainability and scalability.  

## Technologies Used  
- **C# & WPF** – Application development using MVVM pattern.  
- **Entity Framework** – Database integration for storing and querying dive logs.  
- **LiveCharts** – Data visualization for reports.  

## Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kriskensy/WSB_DesktopApps_Project.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.  
3. Build the project and run the application.
